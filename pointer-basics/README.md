# pointer-basics

Create a program that will create, initialize, assign, and access a pointer.

The program should have an integer variable with a hard-coded value. Assign that variable's address to a pointer variable. Display as output the address of the pointer, the value of the pointer, and the value of what the pointer is pointing to.
