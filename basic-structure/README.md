# basic-structure

Create a program that declares a structure and prints out its content.

The program should create an `employee` structure with three members:

- name (character array)
- hire date (character array)
- salary (float)

Declare and initialize an instance of an employee type. Read in a second employee from the console and store it in a structure of type `employee`. Print out the contents of each employee.
