# calculate-weekly-pay

The program should ask the user to enter the number of hours worked in a week via the keyboard and display as output the gross pay, taxes, and net pay.

The following assumptions should be made:

- Basic pay rate is $12/hr
- Overtime pay rate is 1.5 times basic pay
- Tax rate is 15% of the first $300, 20% of the next $150, and 25% of the rest
