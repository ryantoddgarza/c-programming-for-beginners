# writing-functions

Create a program containing three functions.

The program should contain:

A function wich finds the **greatest common divisor** of two non-negative integer values and return the result. The function should take two `int`s as parameters.

A function which calculates the **absolute value** of a number. The function should take a `float` as a paramter and return a `float`.

A function which computes the **square root** of a number. If a negative argument is passed, display an error message and return `-1`. Use the absolute value function as implemented in the above step.
