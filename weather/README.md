# weather

Create a program that uses a two-dimensional array in a weather program.

The program will find the total rainfall for each year, the average yearly rainfall, and the average rainfall for each month. Input will be a two-dimensional array with hard-coded rainfall amounts for the past five years. The array should have 5 rows and twelve columns. Rainfall amounts should be floating point numbers.
