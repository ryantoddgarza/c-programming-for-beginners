# pointer-arithmetic

Create a program that tests your understanding of pointer arithmetic and the const modifier.

Write a function that calculates the length of a string. The function should take as a parameter a const char pointer and return the length of the string as an int. The function should only calculate the length of the string using pointer arithmetic. You are required to use a while loop using the value of the pointer to exit. The function should subtract two pointers (one pointing to the beginning of the string and one pointing to the end).
