# common-string-functions

Create a program that will help you better understand how to use the most common functions in the string library.

Write a program that displays a string in reverse order. Read input from the keyboard and use the `strlen` library function.

Write a program that sorts the strings of an array using bubble sort. Use the `strcmp` and `strcpy` functions.

```sh
Number of strings to sort: 3

Input strings (3):
foo
bar
baz

Sorted strings:
bar
baz
foo
```
