# understanding-char-arrays

Create a program that tests your understanding of character arrays.

Write a function to **count the number of characters in a string**. Do not use the `strlen` library function. The function should take a character array as a parameter and return the length as an integer.

Write a function to **concatenate two character strings**. Do not use the `strcat` library function. The function should take three parameters:

1. `char result[]`
2. `char str1[]`
3. `char str2[]`

The function should not return a value.

Write a function to **determine if two strings are equal**. Do not use the `strcmp` library function. The function should take two constant character arrays as parameters and return a boolean value of `true` if they are equal and `false` otherwise.
