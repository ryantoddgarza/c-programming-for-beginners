# tic-tac-toe

Create a tic-tac-toe C program.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid by two players who take turns. You should create an array to represent the board where each element represents a coordinate on the board that the user can select. Some functions you should probably create are:

- `check_for_win` - checks to see if a player has won or if the game is a draw
- `draw_board` - redraws the board for each player turn
- `mark_board` - sets the array with a selection if valid
