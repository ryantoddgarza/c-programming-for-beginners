# to-uppercase

Create a program that converts all characters in a file to uppercase.

The program should read the contents of a file, write the converted characters to a temporary file, and replace the original file with the temporary file (with the original filename). Use the `fgetc`, `fputc`, `remove`, `rename`, and `islower` functions. You can convert a character to uppercase py subtracting 32 from it. Display the converted contents to standard output.
