# guess-the-number

The program should generate a number from 0 to 20 then ask the user to guess it. Valid input should only be numbers 0 to 20 and an error should be displayed if the user guesses outside of the bounds. The program will indicate to the user whether each guess is high or low. The user wins if they guess the number within five tries.
